# A-MS_design
#Digital electronics:
1) ALU
>Designed ALU in Verilog, completed RTL synthesis, and implemented full-chip layout including floorplanning, and P&R.
>Implemented power planning, guard rings, and IR drop mitigation; exported final GDSII and verified in Virtuoso.
2) CAN TRANSMITTER BUFFER
>Designed and optimized a CAN transmitter buffer module in Verilog code utilizing FSM concepts for reducing complexity.
>Developed a Verilog test bench with sample inputs and ran simulations to analyze outputs and validate design functionality.
3) NOR3
>Designed schematic and layout level design of 2 and 3 input NOR gate in TSMC 65nm and GPDK045nm using Virtuoso
>Performed spectre simulation analyzing circuit characterstics, layout verification including DRC, LVS and QRC using Assura and Quantus and Post layout simulation.

#Mixed signal design for high speed circuits:-
1) CTLE
>Developed a Continuous-Time Linear Equalizer for SerDes Receiver with a focus on optimizing performance.
>Designed peaking control using a variable MOS capacitor.
>Validated gain and bandwidth via AC analysis and FFT-based signal evaluation in Virtuoso.
2) SAR_ADC
>Designed a SAR-based ADC in 65nm CMOS using Cadence Virtuoso; optimized for 5GHz sampling rate.
>Optimized various sub blocks to support conversion rates up to 5GHz boosting speed by a factor of nearly 100
3) SERIALIZER
>Designed a high performance SERDES transceiver using Cadence Virtuoso on the CMOS 65nm process.
>Architected and implemented a 4:1 serializer for a high-speed transmitter, including digital logic (MUX, D-FF, D-latch) and analog driver circuits (pre-driver, voltage driver) for impedance matching with the channel.
